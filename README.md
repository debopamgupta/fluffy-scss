## How to Sass?

All things are explored here and commented (kind of).
A lesson for myself in future maybe.

## Get up and running

You need some kind of sass compiler installed, I used Dart Sass.

```sh
npm install -g sass
```

Check the official installation docs [here](https://sass-lang.com/install).
Also a _Live Sass Compiler_ VSCode extension is available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass)

## Run sass in watch mode

```sh
$ sass --watch sass/:styles/
```

This will watch for sass files in `styles` directory and output css files in `public` directory.

### Enjoy Learning!
